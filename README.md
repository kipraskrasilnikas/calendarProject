# A calendar project with raw Javascript, made to showcase my skills and coding style in the front-end department.

<p>

This is an event calendar app for work, where a user can view, create and delete events. 

An event is created by clicking on the desirable day of the calendar, inputing the event information and clicking "Save". There are 3 types of events: Call, Meeting and Out Of Office. 

After saving, the event is displayed on the selected day, with a color corresponding to the type of event. 

Finally, it is possible to view the event by clicking on it, after the possibility of deleting the event is shown too.

The calendar is always current, it is possible to switch between months with the buttons "Back" and "Next".
